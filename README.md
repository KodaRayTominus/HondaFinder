               - FIRST STEPS -
               
           1. Create user interface that lets you pick whether you are adding or buying
           
           
           2. Create the classes with properties and data annotations
           
//2, 3 any order          
           
           3. Create user inteface to add a car to the database  
                    // because there are specific models, years, and available colors
                    // I recomend we use dropDown menues for the adding process and fill them with
                    // realistic strings  ex: accord, crv, pilot, civic, prelude
                    // milage would be an acceptable text input
                   
                   
           4. Create database using entity code first approach based on the classes
